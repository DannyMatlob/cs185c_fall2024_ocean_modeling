# The Effect of Florida on Ocean Currents

This modeling project is an example to demonstrate the approximate scope, files, and organization of a class project for CS 185C.

## Project Description
In this project, I will investigate the effects of Florida on the ocean. In particular, I will investigate the following science question:

*How does the landmass of Florida affect ocean currents and temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico*

To investigate this question, I will construct a model spanning from Mexico City to South Carolina and run my model simulation for three years in two experiments: a run with Florida intact and a run with the landmass of Florida turned into ocean. I chose a timespan of five years in order to give the ocean time to acclimate to the removal of Florida. I anticipate that the model with Florida removed will have colder temperatures and possibly the formation of gyres in the Gul of Mexico, because water will be allowed to flow in from the Atlantic Ocean.

For initial conditions, I will use the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January of 2019. Similarly, I will construct boundary and external forcing conditions for this model from the ECCO Version 5 model output. To analyze the results, I will create a visualization of ocean currents in the area with and without Florida. I will also create a timeseries of temperatures at different points in the Gulf of Mexico. For visualization, I will create a movie of temperature differences between the model with Florida and the model without Florida.
